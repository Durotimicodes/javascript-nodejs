## KEY INFORMATION TO NOTE ABOUT JS
- JS is a high-level Object Oriented and dynamic programming language

## Data types
- Number ( in JS their is no float or int value just Numbers)
- BigInt
- Symbol 
- undefined
- Boolean
- String
- null

## Variables
- Let is Blocked scoped 
- Var is function scoped 
- Never write a variable without properly declaring it, because JS will create a property on the global object

## Bug in JS
- typeof null is a object instead of null

## Operators and Operator Precedence
** power e.g 2 ** 3 = 8
- For Operator Precedence check mozilla developer netword [www.develope.mozilla.org]
- It is a general rule in JS that a maths operations are done before the comparasion operators.

## Template Literal to concantinate multiple datatypes easily
- ${whatever type can be placed insided this braces}

## Type conversion and Coercion
- Type conversion is when we manually or explicitly convert one type to value to another. Note it is the type that is converted not the variable
let x = '18'
let y = 'Timi
NaN := Not a Number , it is a number but an invalid number
e.g to convert a string to Number use Number(x) and to convert a number to string use String(y)

- Type coersion is when JS automatically helps to convert the type and it happens implicitly i.e. completely hidden from us. 
In type coersion the "+" operator converts the number to strings while the "-" and "/" operators converts the strings to numbers


## falsy and truthy values
- falsy values are values that become false when we try to convert them to a boolean [ 0, '', undefined, null, NaN ]
Boolean(0) // false
Boolean(NaN) //false
- other values other than these are called truthy values e.g. 1 , 'Timi' 
Boolean('Timi') //true
Boolean({}) //true



## Joining Switch Statements and making use of template literal
const day = 'Tuesday'

switch(day) {
    case 'Monday': 
    case 'Tuesday':
    case 'Wednesday':
    case 'Thursday':
    console.log(`Today is ${day}`)
    break

    default:
    console.log(`Todat is unknown`)
}

## Statments and Expressions
- An Expression is a piece of code that produces a value
- A Statement doesnot produce a value but performs some or a action e.g an If else and switch statement

## continue and break
continue is exit the current iteration of the loop and move to the next, in other words skip while break completely terminates the iteration.

## AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER
Avoid side effects and encourage functional purity
By Avoiding side effects : you do not write a function that reintializes a variable that is globally scoped.

By encouraging functional purity : you make sure you return a value in a function so as to avoid an undefined result. Hence it becomes deterministic

## ADVANCE JAVASCRIPT CONCEPTS : CLOSURE, CURRYING 
Closures := a function ran ,the function executed. Its never going to exercute again,
//but its going to remember that there are references to those variables so the child scope function always have access to the parent scope function

Currying is a process of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes it one at a time.
why curry ? because it makes code extensible.


## COMPOSE 
Compose:= this is act of putting two functions together to form a 3rd function where the output of one function is the input of the other

## map , filter and reduce 
map :does the exact samething as forEach just that its better because map has a restriction you need to return a value

reduce : you can filter and iterate with reduce

## PASSED BY VALUE & PASSED BY REFERENCE 
 primite types are immutable i.e one can not change them. In other to change them one has to remove the primitive type.

 objects are passed by reference, and this is beneficial because we are saving space in memory.

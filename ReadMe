## KEY INFORMATION TO NOTE ABOUT JS
- JS is a high-level Object Oriented and dynamic programming language

## Data types
- Number ( in JS their is no float or int value just Numbers)
- BigInt
- Symbol 
- undefined
- Boolean
- String
- null

## Variables
- Let is Blocked scoped 
- Var is function scoped 
- Never write a variable without properly declaring it, because JS will create a property on the global object

## Bug in JS
- typeof null is a object instead of null

## Operators and Operator Precedence
** power e.g 2 ** 3 = 8
- For Operator Precedence check mozilla developer netword [www.develope.mozilla.org]
- It is a general rule in JS that a maths operations are done before the comparasion operators.

## Template Literal to concantinate multiple datatypes easily
- ${whatever type can be placed insided this braces}

## Type conversion and Coercion
- Type conversion is when we manually or explicitly convert one type to value to another. Note it is the type that is converted not the variable
let x = '18'
let y = 'Timi
NaN := Not a Number , it is a number but an invalid number
e.g to convert a string to Number use Number(x) and to convert a number to string use String(y)

- Type coersion is when JS automatically helps to convert the type and it happens implicitly i.e. completely hidden from us. 
In type coersion the "+" operator converts the number to strings while the "-" and "/" operators converts the strings to numbers


## falsy and truthy values
- falsy values are values that become false when we try to convert them to a boolean [ 0, '', undefined, null, NaN ]
Boolean(0) // false
Boolean(NaN) //false
- other values other than these are called truthy values e.g. 1 , 'Timi' 
Boolean('Timi') //true
Boolean({}) //true

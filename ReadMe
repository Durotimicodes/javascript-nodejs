## KEY INFORMATION TO NOTE ABOUT JS
- JS is a high-level Object Oriented and dynamic programming language

## Data types
- Number ( in JS their is no float or int value just Numbers)
- BigInt
- Symbol 
- undefined
- Boolean
- String
- null

## Variables
- Let is Blocked scoped 
- Var is function scoped 
- Never write a variable without properly declaring it, because JS will create a property on the global object

## Bug in JS
- typeof null is a object instead of null

## Operators and Operator Precedence
** power e.g 2 ** 3 = 8
- For Operator Precedence check mozilla developer netword [www.develope.mozilla.org]
- It is a general rule in JS that a maths operations are done before the comparasion operators.

## Template Literal to concantinate multiple datatypes easily
- ${whatever type can be placed insided this braces}

## Type conversion and Coercion
- Type conversion is when we manually or explicitly convert one type to value to another. Note it is the type that is converted not the variable
- Type coersion is when JS automatically helps to convert the type and it happens implicitly i.e. completely hidden from us.
